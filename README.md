# Decision Together

The goal of this evaluation is to determine which end of life residential MSW management system should be implemented for Middle Tennessee communities. As the current regional landfill will close in 5-8 years, Middle Tennessee counties and cities are evaluating future alternatives for MSW management. To evaluate this goal, AHP will be used to compare criteria and scenarios against the goal to identify areas of consensus and disagreement between diverse stakeholders while using pairwise comparison.
